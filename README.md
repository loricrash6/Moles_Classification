# Moles_Classification

This work has been developed for the ICT for Health course at Politecnico di Torino in Fall 2019.

It explores methods to study photos of moles in order to identify potentially dangerous moles and melanomas. The goal would be to build an application for a first quick diagnosis tool that may be of aid for the doctors and the patients.

To see how the algorithm works on a mole, run the "main.py" Python script.

All the detailed description of the work and the algorithm is available in the pdf report that is attached in this repo.
